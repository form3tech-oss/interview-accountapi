# Form3 Take Home Exercise

## Instructions
The goal of this exercise is to write a client library in Go to access our fake account API, which is provided as a Docker
container in the file `docker-compose.yaml` of this repository. Please refer to the
[Form3 documentation](http://api-docs.form3.tech/api.html#organisation-accounts) for information on how to interact with the API.

If you encounter any problems running the fake account API we would encourage you to do some debugging first,
before reaching out for help.

## Acceptance Critera
### Shoulds
The finished solution **should:**
- Be written in Go.
- Be a client library suitable for use in another software project.
- Implement the `Create`, `Fetch`, and `Delete` operations on the `accounts` resource.
- Be well tested to the level you would expect in a commercial environment.
- Contain documentation of your technical decisions.
- Be simple and concise.
- Have tests that run from `docker-compose up` - our reviewers will run `docker-compose up` to assess if your tests pass.

### Should Nots
The finished solution **should not:**
- Use a code generator to write the client library.
- Use (copy or otherwise) code from any third party without attribution to complete the exercise, as this will result in the test being rejected.
- Use a library for your client (e.g: go-resty). Only test or non-client libraries are allowed (e.g. for UUID types).
- Implement an authentication scheme.
- Implement support for the fields `data.attributes.private_identification`, `data.attributes.organisation_identification`
  and `data.relationships`, as they are omitted in the provided fake account API implementation.
- Have advanced features, like retries, metrics or tracing.
- Be a command line client or other type of program - the requirement is to write a client library.
- Implement the `List` operation.

> We give no credit for including any of the above in a submitted test, so please only focus on the "Shoulds" above.
